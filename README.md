# Data-Analysis - Social Buzz Content Categories Analysis
I developed and created different visualizations using Excel to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, Data Collection, Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualizations.

## Project Overview
Social Buzz is a rapidly expanding technology unicorn that generates over 100,000 posts per day, amounting to a staggering 36.5 million pieces of content annually. The challenge faced by the Analytics team at Social Buzz is how to effectively capitalize on this vast volume of content. This project, conducted as part of a three-month Proof of Concept (POC) with Accenture, focuses on auditing Social Buzzâ€™s big data practices and identifying its top 5 most popular content categories.

## Problem
With an overwhelming amount of data, the challenge lies in identifying which content categories generate the most engagement and popularity. The objective was to analyze and determine the top 5 most popular content categories to inform future content strategy decisions and enhance user engagement.

## Process
**Data Collection:** 
Gathered sample datasets containing information about content categories and their respective popularity metrics.
**Data Preprocessing:** 
Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency across the datasets.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
Performed an initial examination of the data, focusing on the distribution of content categories and calculated aggregate popularity scores to uncover trends.
**Visualization:** 
Created various visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and pie charts to represent the distribution and popularity metrics of different content categories.
**Analysis and Conclusion:** 
Analyzed the visualizations and popularity metrics to identify the top-ranking content categories, which were then presented as actionable insights for the content strategy.
Insights
## Analysis
The five most popular content categories identified were Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, and Food. These categories showed that people enjoy "real-life" and "tactile" content the most, with an emphasis on practical and relatable topics.
## Key Insight
Food was a common theme in the top 5 categories, with Healthy Eating ranking the highest. This may indicate that your user base has a strong interest in health-related topics, especially food and diet. This insight presents an opportunity for creating targeted campaigns or collaborating with healthy eating brands to further boost user engagement.
## Conclusion
This analysis successfully identified the top 5 most popular content categories within Social Buzz's vast content database. By leveraging these insights, Social Buzz can enhance its content strategy, optimize its resource allocation, and improve user engagement. The recommendations provided in this project will assist in aligning Social Buzz's content creation with audience preferences, driving long-term growth.
